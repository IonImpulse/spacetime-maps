You can probably ignore these files.
These are backups of [Cavalry](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/) animation files that I used for [the YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC2VQ-oyDG0).
They're lightweight enough to keep in Git.
Unfortunately, they contain hardcoded paths to files that I only have locally, so they'd require some fiddling to make work for other people.
